    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>It is Persian safffron rice pudding, delicate and light in texture</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Jasmine rice</li>
        <li>8 cups water</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons rosewater</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground saffron</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup slivered almonds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, combine 8 cups of water, the rinsed rice and salt and bring to a gentle boil, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Once the rice mixture has come to a boil, lower the flame, partially cover, and cook for 60 minutes. Be sure to stir occasionally to prevent the rice settling in the bottom. Take extra care not to over mix.</li>
        <li>After 60 minutes, the rice should be soft and the mixture reasonably thick.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining ingredients, gently stir and reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>At this stage the pudding should have a creamy and homogeneous substance without any excess liquid. In the event there is excess liquid, continue to cook on low flame uncovered until the right texture has been achieved. Keep in mind that the pudding will harden as it cools down.</li>
        <li>Serve it and garnish with ground cinnamon, slivered pistachios and almonds.</li>
        <li>Place in the refrigerator and serve chilled.</li>
    </ol>
