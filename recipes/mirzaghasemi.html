        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>It is a Persian eggplant dip, based on tandoori or grilled aubergine.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>6 eggplants</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tomatoes</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>After being washed, cleaned and dried, the eggplants need to be roasted over fire. It can be done using the flame of the gas burner, a barbecue, or fire itself. During this process, the skin of the eggplants need to be burned and the inner parts of them must be softer. When roasted, peel the eggplants, and mash them completely.</li>
            <li>Put some water in a small pan. Once it starts boiling, add the tomatoes. They shouldn't be there for a long time, give them enough time to become softer and easier to peel. Then peel and chop the tomatoes. Meanwhile, peel and grate the cloves of the garlic.</li>
            <li>Preheat a pan and some oil. Stir fry the grated garlic and then add the tomatoes. Stir fry the tomatoes for a short while and add the mashed eggplants. Keep stir frying the ingredients and add some  salt and pepper. After a while, the water will be less and the ingredients will look oily.</li>
            <li>This stage is not necessary, but if you want to follow it, make sure you will do it before adding the eggs. To make the dish more beautiful, you can stir fry some tomato paste and then add it to the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>When then water seems to be completely gone, add the eggs and wait for them to cook.</li>
        </ol>
